## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Set up your Supabase database with the required tables:
   ```sql
   -- Players table for real-time multiplayer
   CREATE TABLE players (
     id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
     x INTEGER NOT NULL,
     y INTEGER NOT NULL,
     direction INTEGER DEFAULT 0
   );
   
   -- Game sessions table for persistent sessions
   CREATE TABLE game_sessions (
     session_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
     player_id TEXT NOT NULL,
     x INTEGER NOT NULL,
     y INTEGER NOT NULL,
     direction INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
     last_updated TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
   );
   ```

3. Configure your Supabase credentials in `lib/supabase.js`

4. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Game Architecture

The game uses a component-based architecture with:
- **Game Component**: Main game logic and rendering
- **Session Manager**: Handles session persistence and restoration
- **Canvas Rendering**: Efficient 2D graphics with camera system
- **State Management**: React hooks for player and world state
- **Real-time Sync**: Supabase subscriptions for multiplayer
- **Local Storage**: Browser-based session ID persistence

## Future Enhancements

- Inventory system
- NPCs and quests
